# Examples

A repository with Toit examples, which are also available directly in [console.toit.io](https://console.toit.io/) in the Code tab of your device.

## Running the examples

```bash
toit run example_name.toit
```

You can choose a default device by running

```bash
toit device use <device_name>
```

The examples can also be deployed, but you will need to create a specification file for doing this. Read more at [docs.toit.io](https://docs.toit.io/platform/deploy/runordeploy/).

## Contributing

Pull requests with new examples are welcome.

Please make sure to follow the style of the other examples. We can create the schematic and breadboard overview for you, if you dont have access to drawing tools.

## Comments in code

Remember to keep the line length of comments in the code below approx. 90 chars for easy readability in the Code tab of the Toit console.
